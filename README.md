# Rundoo Take-Home | William Yang

## Why we're asking you to do this ❓

We want you to think of this as less of a test and more of a project or puzzle. The goal of which is to help us both evaluate the following:

1. How much you enjoy this kind of work
2. How you assess tradeoffs in your decision-making

Our hope is that we both come out of this more excited to work together and you already have a head start thinking about things that'll come up on the job!

## What we're asking you to do 💻

Please build an API endpoint for creating a supplier, where a supplier consists of a name, logo, and address. Please also build a screen that exposes a form for entering that data; upon submission of that form, call the API endpoint you created.

### Time ⏳

Feel free to take as much time as you need. We fully expect that you'll take shortcuts and do things out of the ordinary; we can talk about how you'd do things differently when you come in for your onsite!

### Authentication 🔒

Ignore authentication. Assume all pages and endpoints are publicly accessible.

### Data Persistence 💾

Replit exposes an easy-to-use key-value store that you can use to persist data. To learn more, click the database icon in the sidebar. 

### Next.js

In case it wasn't obvious, this is a Next.js app. If you aren't familiar with Next.js, learn all about it in their [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs).

### Other Notes 📝

Feel free to look up anything along the way and use libraries as you see fit. In general, treat this just as you would if we were actually working together and today was another day at work!

### Questions❓

If you have questions at any point, please feel free to email us in our existing email thread.

## What to do when you're finished ✅

First off, 👏 👏 👏  congrats and thank you for putting in the time to work on this!

When you're done, please respond in our existing email thread to let us know!
